Files here are served from the site root.

- **Logo:** add `logo.png` → use as `/logo.png` or in code: `src="/logo.png"`.
- **Site background:** add `background.jpg` (or rename your image) → used as the full-page background behind all content site-wide. Use a high-resolution image (e.g. 1920×1080 or larger); it’s shown with `background-size: cover` and a dark overlay for readability.
- Favicon: add `favicon.ico` for the browser tab icon.
